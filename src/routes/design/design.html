  <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

  <h3>Design is a language</h3>

  <p>Design is a language more than an art. It is an attempt to communicate ideas. Whether you are trying to distinguish between
    items on a restaurant menu, their price, and their description, or trying to build the UI of a complex web application,
    it is the design which communicates what different pieces represent and how they function to the user.
  </p>

  <h3>Languages are effective by being consistent</h3>

  <p>In English, when you read an ‘p’ you know the sound you expect it to represent. Sometimes, the context changes what it
    is communicating, such as when ‘p’ is followed by an ‘h’, but even these discrepancies have a certain consistency to
    them (phone, glyph, “the P-H phat”). This consistency of systems and symbols is what allows a language to function.
  </p>

  <p>The same is true in design. If item names on a menu are red and the descriptions black, this consistency allows me to quickly
    scan the menu for item names, ignoring descriptions until I desire to read them. In site design, this is especially true.
    Keeping your design language consistent within your site allows users to know what to expect when interacting with it.</p>

  <h3>Your design does not exist in isolation</h3>

  <p>When someone interacts with your design, they bring to it expectations which they pick up from similar designs. As such,
    you must consider the design languages that are already established. Again, consistency is key to efficient communication.
    In most cases, remaining consistent with already established systems and patterns is the most effective way to communicate
    with your user.</p>

  <p>To push the English analogy a bit further, imagine traveling to a new place, knowing only English. If the people there
    speak an entirely different language, you may recognize the roots of some key phrases which might share similar etymologies,
    but in general communication will be difficult. If they speak a dialect of English which is not your own, you may occasionally
    have some confusion, but in general you will be able to get by pretty easily. But obviously communication will be smoothest
    if it turns out they speak the same language and dialect that you already know.</p>

  <h3>Design should be subtly beautiful</h3>

  <p>People appreciate beauty and it can have a cathartic effect, enhancing a user's interaction with your design; however,
    a design should avoid calling too much attention to itself. Any attention given to the design is not being paid to the
    message your design is trying to communicate. Overly flashy or superfluous design elements are distracting, and thus
    generally hinder your communication with your user. </p>

  <p>This is not to say that designs should not look good - quite the opposite. Ugly designs call attention to themselves. In
    fact, given the choice between an ugly design, which is distracting and upsetting, and a overly flashy or superfluous
    design, which is distracting but potentially enjoyable, the choice is clear; however, the goal should generally be a
    subtle, unobtrusive beauty. </p>

  <p>When I receive a letter with good penmanship. I might admire the writing when I open the letter and smile, but I then get
    on with the reading. Overly stylized writing might be beautiful, but it is a distraction when reading. Bad penmanship
    is both distracting and often gets in the way. </p>
